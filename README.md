# Stock-analysis Overview:

The purpose of this project was to help my client analyze a list of stocks to determine it's total daily volume which is the total number of shares traded throughout the day with each stock listed and it's return percentage which is the difference in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. I accomplished this using VBA.To help my client I made a button for them to press so it'll be easy to analyze the macro as a whole in one go. I also added the amount of time the analysis took after the button was pressed. I did this because in the near future my client wants to add more stocks on the list. To make sure my analysis runs smoothly I made an additional macro with the same data and solutions but the codes refactored. And so I added another button to test if the run-time of the analysis was shortened.

## Results:

Below are the links of the results for the analysis from the first one and the refactored one. I did in fact made the refactored codes work in my favor by executing it more efficently and faster. One of the first changes I did when refactoring was add an additional array with the amount it has. This eliminated a nested loop that was in the first analysis.

### Summary:

In essence, what was realized was that the stock TerraForm Power(TERP) did not have a good year in 2017. While in 2018 the only stocks that had a good return was Enphase Energy(ENPH) and Sunrun(RUN). This project highlighted the ups and downs of refactoring. The disadvantages of refactoring is not knowing if the code may still work or if it'll still have the same funtionality. However, I would say it has more advantages then anything. Refactoring can be easiy understood because the codes become as one and it's beyond structured.
